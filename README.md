turboEMU
========

turboEMU is an emulator of PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, it should run on Linux/Windows.

The emulator is under development and has many bugs and incomplete features, for now only the HuC6280 is near to be done (and probably very inaccurate).

This projected is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
