turboEMU
========

turboEMU is a PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 emulator, it should run on Linux/Windows.

This emulator is under development and has many bugs and incomplete features, for now only the HuC6280 is near done (and probably very inaccurate).

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
